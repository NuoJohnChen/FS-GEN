Statement 2 | The symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.\n(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True\nA: Let's think step by step. A cyclic group is a group that is generated by a single element. Hence a subgroup generated by a single element of a group is cyclic and Statement 1 is True. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: The symmetric group $S_n$ has $\nactorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.\nFind the characteristic of the ring 2Z.\n(A) 0 (B) 3 (C) 12 (D) 30\nA: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Statement 1| Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. Statement 2 | Every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.\n(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement 1 is true. Let $S$ be a finite set. If $f:S \nightarrow S$ is a onto function, then $|S| = |f(S)|$. If $f$ was not one to one, then for finite domain $S$ the image would have less than $S$ elements, a contradiction.\nStatement 2 is true. Let $G$ be an abelian group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We need to show that $H$ is abelian. Let $a,b \\in H$. Then $a,b \\in G$ and $ab=ba$. Since $G$ is abelian, $ab=ba$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $ab \\in H$. Therefore, $ab=ba$ and $H$ is abelian.

(Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck.

(B) They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart. (C) They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources. (D) They lack paired, jointed appendages.\nA: Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?\n(A) 1/400 (B) 19/400 (C) 20/400 (D) 38/400\nA: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. \u200bThe frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\\sqrt{\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400.

It is a gradient in water pressure that induces the movement of phloem content, which refers to answer (B). The mechanism of movement does not rely on metabolism, which rules out (A). Transpiration refers to the exhalation of water vapor through plant stomata, and is also not related, which rules out (C). While the apoplastic pathway is one of two main pathways for water transport in plants, it is not central to the pressure flow model, which rules out (D).

In the reaction shown above, Cl\u2212(aq) behaves as\n(A) an acid (B) a base (C) a catalyst (D) a reducing agent\nA: Let's think step by step. A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D).

The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) III only\n(D) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles.

This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?\n(A) By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum (B) By changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell (C) By changing the shape of the protein (D) An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity.\nA: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\n(A) Translation (B) Conjugation (C) Specialized transduction (D) Transformation\nA: Let's think step by step. The introduction of foreign DNA or RNA into bacteria or eukaryotic cells is a common technique in molecular biology and scientific research. There are multiple ways foreign DNA can be introduced into cells including transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transfection. In contrast, (A) is not a way to form DNA: during translation the ribosomes synthesize proteins from RNA. The answer is (A).", "high_school_chemistry": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school chemistry.\n\nQ: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?\n(A) HCl (B) H2SO3 (C) SO2 (D) Al(NO3)3\nA: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is expected to be a polar molecule?\n(A) PCl4F (B) BF3 (C) CO2 (D) Si(CH3)4\nA: Let's think step by step. A polar molecule is one that has a slightly positive charge on one end of the molecule and a slightly negative charge on the other end. Boron trifluoride (BF3) has Boron as the center atom and three fluorine atoms attached to it; it is trigonal planar and symmetric, so it is nonpolar. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has Carbon as the central atom with double bonds to two Oxygen atoms - this is also symmetrical and therefore nonpolar. The same is the case for tetramethyl silane (SI(CH3)4), which is a Silicon atom surrounded by four methyl groups. The structure of PCL4F is that Phosphorus is the central atom, attached to four chlorines and one fluorine atom. This is asymmetrical, and therefore has a net dipole and is expected to be a polar molecule. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?\n(A) All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble (B) All sulfates are soluble (C) All hydroxides are soluble (D) All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble\nA: Let's think step by step. The chlorides, bromides, and iodides of lead, silver, and mercury are not soluble in water. This rules out (A). The sulfates of lead, barium, and calcium are not soluble in water, which rules out (B). The hydroxides of any metal besides sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, and barium are insoluble. This rules out (C). Typically ammonium ions indicate a soluble ionic substance.

(B) A hiker uses a G P S watch to keep track of her position. (C) A refrigerator orders milk from an online delivery service when the milk in the refrigerator is almost gone. (D) A runner uses a watch with optical sensors to monitor his heart rate.\nA: Let's think step by step. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to common devices which are connected to the internet, enabling new functionality. Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe an internet connected device. In choice B, the watch is only described as having GPS functionality but no internet connectivity. Choice C describes a common device (a refrigerator) which has internet connectivity enabling new functionality (online ordering). Choice D does not mention internet connectivity for the watch, only optical sensors. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Many Web browsers allow users to open anonymous windows. During a browsing session in an anonymous window, the browser does not record a browsing history or a list of downloaded files. When the anonymous window is exited, cookies created during the session are deleted. Which of the following statements about browsing sessions in an anonymous window is true?\n(A) The activities of a user browsing in an anonymous window will not be visible to people who monitor the user's network, such as the system administrator. (B) Items placed in a Web store's shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user's computer. (C) A user will not be able to log in to e-mail or social media accounts during the anonymous browsing session. (D) A user browsing in an anonymous window will be protected from viruses launched from any web sites visited or files downloaded.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect as it only describes network traffic, which an anonymous browser does not change. Choice B is correct as it correctly describes how an anonymous browser will prevent saving data on the user\u2019s computer after the session is ended. Choice C is incorrect because an anonymous browser will not prevent logging in to email or social media accounts. Choice D is incorrect because an anonymous browser in itself performs no virus protection. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In the program below, the initial value of X is 5 and the initial value of Y is 10.\nIF (X < 0){\n DISPLAY (\"Foxtrot\")\n} ELSE {\n IF (X > Y){\n  DISPLAY (\"Hotel\")\n } ELSE {\n  IF (Y > 0){\n   DISPLAY (\"November\")\n  } ELSE {\n   DISPLAY (\"Yankee\")\n  }\n }\n}\nWhat is displayed as a result of running the program?\n(A) Foxtrot (B) Hotel (C) November (D) Yankee\nA: Let's think step by step. Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY (\"November\") is executed.

Factoring $729=3^6$ and combining the roots $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{12}$, we get that $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{3^6}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{12}}=\\frac{1}{3^{\\frac{1}{2}}}=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}$ The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?\n(A) 12 (B) 1 (C) 30 (D) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. To go from $\\$300$ to $\\$9600$, the value must go up by a factor of $9600/300=32=2^5$. Since at this interest rate it takes six years for it to double, it will take $5*6=30$ years to grow to $\\$9600$.

What is the mean of the students\u2019 test scores?\n(A) 55 (B) 60 (C) 62 (D) 65\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 10 students and the sum of their scores is $45 + 55 + 50 + 70 + 65 + 80 + 40 + 90 + 70 + 85 = 650$, the mean is $650/10=65$.

At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n(A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W\nA: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step. To calculate the work required to move a charge from one location to another in a fixed electric field, it is enough to calculate the potential difference between the two locations. Here, the potential only depends on the distance between the charges; it\u2019s $k q_1 q_2 / r$, where $k$ is Coulomb\u2019s constant. Plugging in values $q_1 = $ 1 mC, $q_2 = 8 \\mu$ C, gives the answer as 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J.

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\n(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nA: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\n(A) The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost. (B) The number of trees affected by the frost. (C) The number of trees sampled from the grove. (D) For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nA: Let's think step by step. In this experiment, the response variable is what is measured. For each tree, what is measured is whether or not it suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\n(A) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5 (B) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13 (C) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17 (D) There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nA: Let's think step by step. While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. The answer is (D).",  "machine_learning": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about machine learning.\n\nQ: Which image data augmentation is most common for natural images?\n(A) random crop and horizontal flip (B) random crop and vertical flip (C) posterization (D) dithering\nA: Let's think step by step. Data augmentation is used to increase the diversity of images in the training dataset. It is important that natural images are kept natural after being augmented. Vertical flips of images are not natural, so (B) is false. Posterization makes the image look like a poster and and dithering increases color depth. None of these two preserve the natural property. The only natural data augmentation technique is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\n(A) It is too computationally expensive. (B) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset. (C) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset. (D) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.\nA: Let's think step by step. Because the input is real valued, it is unlikely that the same values appear both at training and test time. This means that while such a decision tree could yield good performance on the training data, when evaluated on the test data it will perform badly because the decision tree won\u2019t know what to do with numbers that did not appear in the training data. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: You are reviewing papers for the World\u2019s Fanciest Machine Learning Conference, and you see submissions with the following claims. Which ones would you consider accepting?\n(A) My method achieves a training error lower than all previous methods! (B) My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter \u03bb is chosen so as to minimise test error.) (C) My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter \u03bb is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.) (D) My method achieves a cross-validation error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter \u03bb is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.)\nA: Let's think step by step. In machine learning, we train with some data and fixed hyperparameters and the training error can be arbitrarily low, so (A) can\u2019t be right. Then, one compares different hyperparameters by selecting the model with the lowest cross-validation error, this means that (B) and (D) are not the right procedure. The only relevant number after these is the test error and thus (C) is the right answer. The answer is (C)."}
